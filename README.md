# SYS-Learning Package "DevOps"
> A learning pack to learn the basics of DevOps, what it is for and what you need it for.

## DevOps the practice (CI/CD for Example)
DevOps combies development and operations to incerease the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and helps to prevent or solve problems that may arise. DevOps Integrates specialist departments directly in order to speed up the software development process for acceptance and delivery.

CI/CD exists to help these processes. CI stands for "Continuous Integration" (Kontinuierliche Integration), CI is about the regular transfer of code changes from all project members to a central repository. The goal is to create a reliable process for compiling and providing software, by promoting collaboration, automation and feedback cycles. Ideally, this process should be automated and run several times a day.

CD stands for two things: Continuous Delivery (Kontinuierliche Auslieferung) and Continuous Deployment (Kontinuierliche Bereitstellung). Continuous Delivery is the automation of manual steps that are necessary for the compilation and publication of software. The goal is to always keep the code of a project in a release-ready state. Continuous delivery can speed up software delivery processes by making them automated instead of manual.

Continuous deployment, on the other hand, takes the idea of automating build, test and deployment steps. Small code changes are regularly applied by running them through an automatic build and test process. If no problems arise, the changes are transferred to the production process. Continuous deployment allows new features to be implemented as quickly as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> CI/CD are DevOps methods that serve to improve the workflow. They are used to test automated builds and test systems more quickly and to provide better and faster feedback.
