## DevOps the practice (CI/CD for Example)
DevOps combies development and operations to incerease the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and helps to prevent or solve problems that may arise. DevOps Integrates specialist departments directly in order to speed up the software development process for acceptance and delivery.

CI/CD exists to help these processes. CI stands for "Continuous Integration" (Kontinuierliche Integration), CI is about the regular transfer of code changes from all project members to a central repository. The goal is to create a reliable process for compiling and providing software, by promoting collaboration, automation and feedback cycles. Ideally, this process should be automated and run several times a day.

> CI/CD are DevOps methods that serve to improve the workflow. They are used to test automated builds and test systems more quickly and to provide better and faster feedback.

   - Feedback:
     - To give developers quick feedback on the code they have just written
   - Automation:
   - Bugs:
